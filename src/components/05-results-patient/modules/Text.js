      If you chose one or more symptoms that could relate to you being low in
      iron, don’t worry, there’s plenty you can do to relieve iron deficiency
      and its impacts on your life.

      If you didn’t choose any symptoms but you’re still concerned that you, or
      someone you know, may be iron deficient, please speak to your doctor to
      request a dedicated blood test.
