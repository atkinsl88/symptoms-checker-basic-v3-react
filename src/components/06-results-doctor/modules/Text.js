    <p>
      Recognising your patients symptoms is an important step in checking if you
      may have iron deficiency.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you chose one or more symptoms that could relate to you being low in
      iron, don’t worry, there’s plenty you can do to relieve iron deficiency
      and its impacts on your life.
    </p>
    <p>
      To get the most out of the appointment with your Patient, submit their
      details to receive the results of your symptom selection and a free
      Patient Discussion guide.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you didn’t choose any symptoms but you’re still concerned that your
      patient may be iron deficient, please look to advise a dedicated blood
      test.
    </p>
